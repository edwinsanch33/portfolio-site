The Search Bar is a React App for users to find detailed instructions on how to make cocktails. We made a GET request on the back-end to The CocktailDB API. With the information gained we used React to display the results seemlessly on the home page. We use another request that returned all the drinks to be displayed on another page with CSS Grid. A third request was made to display results of a random drink.
